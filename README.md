# Spam/Ham Message Classifier
We'll be using a dataset from the UCI datasets. The file we are using contains a collection of more than 5 thousand SMS phone messages. The data folder also conatins a readme file conating more information of the dataset  Due to the spacing we can tell that this is a TSV ("tab separated values") file, where the first column is a label saying whether the given message is a normal message (commonly known as "ham") or "spam". The second column is the message itself. (Note our numbers aren't part of the file, they are just from the enumerate call).  Using these labeled ham and spam examples, we'll train a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between ham/spam automatically. Then, with a trained model, we'll be able to classify arbitrary unlabeled messages as ham or spam.  link to dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection
